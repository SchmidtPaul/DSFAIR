# DSFAIR - Data Science for Agriculture in R 
[ðŸ“ŠðŸŒ± DSFAIR - Data Science for Agriculture in R](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/DSFAIR/) provides a cookbook with statistical analyses of typical examples in life sciences (focus on agriculture/biology). It can be seen as the smaller brother of [ðŸ“ˆðŸŒ± MMFAIR - Mixed Models for Agriculture in R](https://schmidtpaul.github.io/MMFAIR/), because it deals with more basic analyses.

Where possible, I try to use example data/analyses that have been published in university lecture notes or peer-reviewed journals.
